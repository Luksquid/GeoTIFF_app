Desktop application for displaying NMT (Numerical Terrain Model) raster underlays in TIF format. 
Points from .tiff are converted to pixels using machine graphics and displayed as a raster image and processed by algorithms in python.

Functionality:
- display of NMT raster primers in TIF format
- grayscale and scalar raster display colors (blue->green->red)
- possibility to set scale ranges 
- possibility to measure the value of a given pixel (height)
- generation of height profile based on the line drawn on the raster
- generation of height contours based on map base
